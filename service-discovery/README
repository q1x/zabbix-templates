LLD template for Microsoft Windows Services

For this template to work, a userparameter must be added to the agent configuration.
For example, if the servdisc.ps1 is residing in C:\, the userparameter would look like this:

UserParameter=service.discovery,powershell -File c:\servdisc.ps1

Please note, that the Powershell script is unsigned. Therefor it must be allowed to run unsigned PS scripts on the system.
See http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/PowerShell-Security.html for more info on this.

Also note that on my test system, it took a while before powershell would return results.
This caused timeouts in the agent which resulted in "not supported" errors for the discovery item.
To solve this, I upped the timout in the agent to 10 seconds:

Timeout=10

By default the actual template will do a discovery of all the services that should automatically be started and that are currently in the running state.
It does so by filtering the {#SERVICESTATE} macro for the string "Running".

The following macros are available for filtering if desired:

{#SERVICENAME}		The name of the Windows service
{#SERVICEDISPLAY}	The displayname of the Windows service
{#SERVICESTATE}		The state of the Windows service
{#SERVICEDESC}		The Windows service description

All of these can be used to filter by means of regex matching.

2013-04-10	Mate Juroš was kind enough to provide a .vbs version of the powershell script. I've added it to the repo for completeness. The code is not tested by me, please use it with precaution! TO use the script please create the following UserParameter in the Zabbix Agent:

UserParameter=service.discovery,cscript /B c:\servdisc.vbs
